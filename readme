MOD3 As3Mod 3D Modifier Library port for Javascript and Three.js

This is a port of the AS3Mod Modifier Library for Actionscript 3 to Javascript.
i have named MOD3 (to signify that it has support for THREE.js )

It is a complete port (up to limitations between the 2 frameworks)  and only needs adding more modifiers
For now it contains only 2 Modifiers: Bend and Pivot
However the structure is ready for More Modifiers to be added
Not all Modifiers of AS3Mod can be ported but most can.
It has support for Three.js for now but it is easy to add support for other 3D javascript libraries as well

Examples (with bend modifier) included

Complete source code and minified version

* There seems to be a problem when adding modifiers to multiple objects [SOLVED see MeshProxy.js]
(the modifiers for each successive object are run together with the modifiers of the previous object see Bend2-problem example), 

* build with build2.py if having problems with encoding
build.py is customized to work with my windows codepage so check between build.py and build2.py which has no encoding hard-coded
