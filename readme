MOD3 As3Mod 3D Modifier Library port for Javascript and Three.js and Pre3d

This is a port of the AS3Mod Modifier Library for Actionscript 3 to Javascript.
i have named MOD3 (to signify that it has support for THREE.js )

It is a complete port (up to limitations between the 2 frameworks)
Not all Modifiers of AS3Mod can be ported but most can.
However the structure is ready for More Modifiers to be added

It has support for Three.js for now but it is easy to add support for other 3D javascript libraries as well
* added support for Pre3d with examples (my pre3d examples are a liitle blurry but you'll get the picture)

Modifiers supported (up to present)
* Pivot
note: Pivot does not work with Pre3d
* Bend
* Twist
* Taper
* Skew
* Noise
* Wheel
* Bloat
* Break

Examples  included
Examples include 3D Flip Book with Three.js, MOD3.js (bend and pivot) and Tween.js

Complete source code and minified version

* There seems to be a problem when adding modifiers to multiple objects [SOLVED see MeshProxy.js]
(the modifiers for each successive object are run together with the modifiers of the previous object see Bend2-problem example), 

* build if having problems with encoding set -enc option in build.bat
